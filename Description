Authentication and Authorization:
    1.Implement token-based authentication using JWT.
    2.Add role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain routes.

Monitoring
    1.Use Prometheus for metrics and Grafana for visualization.

Monitor:
    1.API response times and error rates.
    2.Database query performance.
    3.Container health and resource usage.

Stateful Considerations:
    1.Ensure database transactions are ACID-compliant.
    2.Implement session management for user authentication.
    3.Use distributed caching (e.g., Redis) for scalability.
